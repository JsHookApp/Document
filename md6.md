`kernelsu`[https://github.com/tiann/KernelSU](https://github.com/tiann/KernelSU)

`apatch`[https://github.com/bmax121/APatch](https://github.com/bmax121/APatch)

Module depends on `zygisk/riru`, You need to install any of the following modules to support the activation of jshook

`zygisk`[https://github.com/Dr-TSNG/ZygiskNext](https://github.com/Dr-TSNG/ZygiskNext)

`riru`[https://github.com/RikkaApps/Riru](https://github.com/RikkaApps/Riru)
